                Just as it was stunningly predicted in my last blog post–it’s been a while. Or to be exact 5 months and 2 days. A new record! 🎉
                I haven’t really done much on the website over these last couple of months; school has hit hard. 
                Anyway, things have been picking up recently so I’m gonna update the projects with some new stuff I’ve done. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                Now that that’s out of the way, let me get started with this update. There’s nothing really central about this blog post so I guess it’s time to continue with the uncreative name arc: “Winter Update or: I Need Better Names”. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                Did some things on GitHub:<br></br>
                <ul className='pl-[20px]'>
                    <li>1. Finally finished the Rate My AP’s project - never really went anywhere but whatever<br></br></li>
                    <li>2. Dogmash - I guess I wanted to learn about ELO?<br></br></li>
                    <li>3. Cron Sentiment Analysis - Just a fork<br></br></li>
                    <li>4. News Classifier - It’s been a fun weekend, let me actually talk a bit about it.<br></br><br></br></li>
                </ul>
                
                Ok, so News Classifier. That along with the Audax Labs Internship project are the main things I’ve been doing this weekend (and I guess this blog, what a momentous occasion). I have been doing all this stuff while grinding a playlist of the Smiths, my Spotify Stats are going to be crazy:

                <p className='text-center'>Credit to Stats for Spotify.</p><br></br><br></br>
                So the News Classifier. I don’t know I guess I wanted to do stuff with Machine Learning and Web Dev. More importantly, this project has confirmed a long-standing suspicion of mine: python SUCKS for web dev. Never using Streamlit again - 2/10 (admittedly, I used it again with the internship, though that’s probably gonna change).  
                <br></br><br></br>
                What else was I gonna talk about? I don’t know.
                Well, I guess that’s it.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Merry Christmas! 🧑‍🎄 Happy Hanukkah! Happy New Year!
