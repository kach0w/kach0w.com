                Sorry, I haven't posted here in a while. I was still working on more github projects over the summer but I forgot to 
                update what I've done here. Anyways, school started and in my stats class because we were only going to start using 
                calculators next week I wanted to make something to graph and display data from points that a user inputs. I saw my 
                dad using chart js so I kept it in the back of my mind to use for later. And then when I saw <a href="https://github.com/oliver-ni/rsquared">this project</a>
                and combined with the stats class beginning, I was motivated to create this project. At the time I'm writing this I 
                have not added things like mean, median, mode and standard deviation yet but I am planning on doing that soon. <br />
                <br />
                So here's the app: <a className='text-[#3b82f6] hover:underline' href="https://kach0w-statistics.herokuapp.com/">https://kach0w-statistics.herokuapp.com/</a><br />
                <br />
                Also tomorrow it's labor day so whenever you're reading this, I hope you have a nice day.  
                    <br></br>

                        Till next time,
